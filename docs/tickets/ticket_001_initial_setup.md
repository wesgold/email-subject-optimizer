# Ticket: AI Email Subject Line Optimizer - Initial Setup

## Problem to Solve
We need to build an AI-powered email subject line optimizer that can generate multiple subject line variations, track their performance through A/B testing, and cache results for efficiency. The system should help improve email open rates by providing data-driven subject line suggestions.

## Solution Outline
Create a Python-based system that:
1. Takes email body content as input
2. Generates 5 optimized subject line variations using prompt engineering
3. Implements caching to avoid regenerating for identical emails
4. Tracks A/B test results for continuous improvement
5. Provides analytics on which subjects get clicked

## Technical Requirements
- Basic prompt engineering for subject generation
- Response caching patterns using email content hash
- Simple A/B test tracking mechanism
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Analytics dashboard for click tracking

## Learning Goals
- Basic prompt engineering techniques
- Response caching patterns
- Simple A/B test tracking implementation
- Rate limiting strategies

## Success Criteria
- System generates 5 varied, relevant subject lines for any email
- Caching reduces API calls by 50%+ for duplicate content
- A/B testing data is tracked and accessible
- Analytics show click-through rates for different subject variations

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Database Setup ✅
- Database models implemented (Base, ABTest, TestVariation, EmailPerformance)
- Configuration system with environment variables
- Caching layer with both Redis and file-based options
- All verification tests passing

### Phase 2: AI Integration & Rate Limiting ✅
- AI Service Abstraction implemented with OpenAI and Anthropic providers
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff and jitter
- Subject Generator Service with caching and A/B test tracking
- All verification tests passing
- Note: API keys need to be configured in .env file (see .env.example)

### Phase 3: API Endpoints (Pending)
- FastAPI endpoints for subject generation and analytics
- To be implemented next

### Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting (Pending)
- Performance tracking and analytics dashboard
- To be implemented after API endpoints
